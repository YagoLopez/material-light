**Material Designt UI components for Angular (versions 4 +)**

There are other adaptations of Material Design Lite and other UI frameworks like the official Material Design 2, 
but this library has the following features:

- 100% Free forever.
- Fast
- Light
- Easy and fun to use
- Library of true componentes encapsulating typescipt code, CSS and HTML as atomic units
- Easy and quick form validation
- Great performance on mobile apps.
- Responsive content adaptable to desktop and mobile
- Components available also as Angular Modules allowing Code-Splitting/Lazy-loading. This implies loading only the components needed at runtime
- Ready for Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT)
- Tested in main desktop/mobile browsers: Chrome (Android, IOS, desktop), FF, Edge, IE, Opera. <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html" target="_blank">(Browsers supported)</a>
- No dependencies of other libraries like JQuery or Bootstrap.

## Objective

The main goal was to achieve minimalism and performance, not to encompass all posible kind of options or UI components (this is the philosophy of
Material Design Light too). You can always add other components from other sources.

## Demo

<!-- - <a href="http://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/iframe/iframe.html" target="_blank">Desktop PC</a> -->
- <a href="http://mobt.me/Xf27" target="_blank">Mobile Simulator (For Desktop)</a>
- <a href="https://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/dist/index.html" target="_blank">Full Screen (For Mobile)</a>

## Insallation and Use

- To install, run: `npm install YagoLopez/material-light --save-dev`
- This project can be used with the **angular-cli** although not mandatory.
- Include Material Icons from `{project-folder}/src/assets/fonts/mlIcons.css` in your `index.html`
- To have AOT working you must execute the following steps:
1. Copy `{project-folder}/node_modules/material-light/src/app/ml/` folder to your `/src/` folder
2. Copy `{project-folder}/node_modules/material-light/src/assets/` folder to your `/src/` folder
- Import the component modules from `{project-folder}/src/app/ml/components` in your own module. Component modules have `*Mod.ts` file name
- For example, if you want to use `MlButton`, import `MlButtonMod.ts` in your module and place `<ml-button>my button</ml-button>` in your template
- Use the components following the examples in the `{project-folder}/node_modules/material-light/src/app/pages` directory.
- Use `<ml-layout>` as base component to place inside it all other components

## Theming

Basisc theming can be achieved using Angular special selectors in the root component:

```CSS
<style>
  /* Header theme */
  :host /deep/ ml-header {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    color: yellow;
   }
   
  /* Content theme */
  :host /deep/ ml-content {
    background: lightblue;
  }
</style>
```

For advanced theming, CSS selectors must be used. Inspect the DOM using developer tools. For example:

```CSS
<style>
  /* Button colored theme */
  :host /deep/ ml-button.mdl-button--raised.mdl-button--colored {
    background: brown;
  }
  
  /* Button accent theme */
  :host /deep/ ml-button.mdl-button--raised.mdl-button--accent {
    background: green;
  }
</style>  
```

## Running the demo

- You can run the compiled demo pointing a web server to `{project-folder}/node_modules/material-light/dist/index.html`
- If you want to compile the project, clone or download the repo, adjust the `basePath` in `app.module.ts` to your environment and run it with `ng serve`

## Testing

<div>Tests with the colaboration of:</div>

## Used for running this demo:

- Angular latest versions
- Angular Command Line (angular-cli)
- Typescript latest versions
- Webpack for production builds
- SystemJS as module loader during development time
- Node/Npm latest versions
